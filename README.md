# True_Auto_Correct

>*works better with python

Simple autocomplete plugin that would suggest possible word completions from:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 * Text in the current file/tab
 
 * Python keywords.


Right now, completions are case sensitive and are listed for 3 or more characters words (both should be configurable settings in the near future).
